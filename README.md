# Motion_Detector

This python script makes use of the inbuilt motion detector algorithm provided by OpenCV-MOG2 to detect any motion in the given frame. We can select the area to which we wish to apply the motion detector by using mouse clicks. Select the two corner points(top-left and bottom-right) on the main frame using mouse clicks. It detects the are where motion is detected and draws contours on the main video frame and gives a text indication of weather motion is detected or not.
